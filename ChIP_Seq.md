## Part b
#### what the method does
Combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with ultra high-throughput massively parallel sequencing.
Allows mapping of protein-DNA interactions in vivo on a genome scale.
Enables mapping of transcription factor binding, DNA binding proteins, RNA PoI II occupancy or Histone modification marks at genome scale.

#### make the link (technology -> application -> statistics)
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) -> ChIP-Seq -> Poisson distributions, a negative binomial,...（ Used in peak calling process）
