## summary of "how it works"
The 10X Chromium platform is used for advanced single cell genomics, where the genetic information of single cells is analyzed instead of a pooled sample of DNA. The technology works by partitioning single cells using microfluidics approaches. Each cell is then contained within a droplet combined with a single gel bead and additional reagents. These beads carry one specific barcode by which the droplet can be identified. This will allow the sequencing reads of each droplet to be mapped back to their origin.
