## summary of "how it works"
The 10X Chromium platform is used for haplotype phasing, structural variant detection and de novo genome assemblies. The technology works by compartmentalizing DNA samples together in nonoliter volume oil droplets together with beads carrying one of specific barcode by which the droplet can be identified.

# Part b
## what the ChIP-Seq does

#### Combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with ultra high-throughput massively parallel sequencing.

#### Allows mapping of protein-DNA interactions in vivo on a genome scale.

#### Enables mapping of transcription factor binding, DNA binding proteins, RNA PoI II occupancy or Histone modification marks at genome scale.

## make the link (technology -> application -> statistics)

#### Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) -> ChIP-Seq -> Poisson distributions, a negative binomial,...（ Used in peak calling process）
