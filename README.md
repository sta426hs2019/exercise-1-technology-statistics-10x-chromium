### Group 6


___
## Part a
#### summary of "how it works"
#### several links with a more general descriptions of this technique

[Van Andel Institute](https://rtsf.natsci.msu.edu/sites/_rtsf/assets/File/10X%20Chromium%20-%20Single%20Cell%20and%20Long%20Read%20Sequencing%20Applications%20and%20Workflow-4.pdf)

___

## Part b
#### what the method does
Combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with ultra high-throughput massively parallel sequencing.
Allows mapping of protein-DNA interactions in vivo on a genome scale.
Enables mapping of transcription factor binding, DNA binding proteins, RNA PoI II occupancy or Histone modification marks at genome scale.

#### make the link (technology -> application -> statistics)
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) -> ChIP-Seq -> Poisson distributions, a negative binomial,...（ Used in peak calling process）
